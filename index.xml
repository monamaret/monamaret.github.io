Besides the fact that it is objectively cool, Vi is included in the standard set of applications packed into the most basic and stripped-down distros of Linux. If you do a lot of systems administration you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually run into a situation where Vi is your only option, and it is kind of embarassing to panic in front of an audience if you&amp;rsquo;re fixing something in a group setting and don&amp;rsquo;t know how to, say, save and quit the file after making a change.</description></item><item><title>Configuring tmux</title><link>https://www.monamaret.com/tmux-config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.monamaret.com/tmux-config/</guid><description>If you want to become a Tmux power user the gold standard reference is of course the wiki but it can be a bit overwhelming if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started and are trying to figure out the basics.

The second rule of dotfiles is don&amp;rsquo;t put your entire damn ~./config directory into version control because that includes a lot of sensitive info and thus violates the first rule.
Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s get serious now that the warnings are out of the way.</description></item></channel></rss>
