> [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (Terminal Multiplexer) is a critically important tool for my daily work. It's also extremely customizable and uses an immense number of keyboard shortcuts, and it's easy to forget how to do something basic like scroll through your history or paste from the clipboard, especially if you use a customized version on one computer and a non-customized version on another. This is where I keep my notes on configuration and other little hacks.
