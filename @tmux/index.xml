      <description>If you want to become a Tmux power user the gold standard reference is of course the wiki but it can be a bit overwhelming if you&amp;rsquo;re just getting started and are trying to figure out the basics. There are also many good beginner guides that go deep on why you might want to learn how to use Tmux and what it does for you. This page, however, is going to focus only on how to configure Tmux and some basic helpful tips, like how to copy/paste and how to scroll back through your history.</description>
