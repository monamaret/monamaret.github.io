      <description>If you spend a lot of time on the command line you should consider learning how to use one of the modal text editors, like Vi or Vim. Besides the fact that it is objectively cool, Vi is included in the standard set of applications packed into the most basic and stripped-down distros of Linux. If you do a lot of systems administration you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually run into a situation where Vi is your only option, and it is kind of embarassing to panic in front of an audience if you&amp;rsquo;re fixing something in a group setting and don&amp;rsquo;t know how to, say, save and quit the file after making a change.</description>

      <title>Using Lua within Neovim configuration</title>
      <link>https://www.monamaret.com/lua-neovim/</link>

      <description>You can use Lua script to configure Neovim, but why might you want to do that? The Vim and Neovim API are written in C, and Lua runs in the C engine; since Lua is significantly easier to write and read than C or even Vimscript, Lua can be used to write complex configuration directives.
Another more explicit reason to use it is because many useful Neovim plugins are written in Lua (like the autocompletion plugins used when setting up Neovim as an IDE) and require extensive configuration directives that can clutter up your init.</description>
