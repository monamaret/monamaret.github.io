The second rule of dotfiles is don&rsquo;t put your entire damn <code>~./config</code> directory into version control because that includes a lot of sensitive info and thus violates the first rule.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get serious now that the warnings are out of the way. There are many tools to manage your dotfiles, like <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html>GNU Stow</a>, but I use a simple .sh script and a symlink between specific files in my config directory and a separate, sanitized directory I can check into version control without fear named, creatively, <code>~/dotfiles</code>. I also name the repository <a href=https://github.com/monamaret/dotfiles>dotfiles</a> because I like consistency.</p><h2 id=separating-config-and-dotfiles>separating ./config and /dotfiles</h2><p>I am a Linux person and use an Arch-flavored distribution on my main computer. Even if you start managing your dotfiles from a fresh-ish install of something like Manjaro, you&rsquo;ll have a lot of stuff in your <code>.config</code> directory you probably don&rsquo;t want to track in version control. So the first step is to figure out what you do want to track. My personal rule is: if I care enough to create a custom configuration, I want to track it in version control. For me this means the absolute minimum is:</p><ul><li>Neovim</li><li>Tmux</li><li>Zsh</li></ul><h3 id=neovim-config>Neovim config</h3><p>Aside from the LSP config (which <a href=/neovim-lsp/>I go into deeper elsewhere</a>) probably the most important thing to be aware of regarding tracking Neovim config is that you don&rsquo;t want to check your undo file into version control because sensitive stuff could be in there. When we get to the install script you&rsquo;ll see that it is not symlinked and that is intentional - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=neovim+symlink+undo+file">it can cause major system problems</a>. However, the steps the install script takes involves deleting the config directory which contains the undo file, and if you don&rsquo;t re-create it you&rsquo;ll lose the ability to step backwards.</p><p>The primary config file for Neovim is <code>init.vim</code> and it lives in the <code>~/.config/nvim</code> directory. See <a href=/basic-neovim>this page</a> for a detailed look at the basics of configuring Neovim.</p><h3 id=tmux-config>Tmux config</h3><p>If you customize your keyboard commands or change the leader key in Tmux it is probably critical to track your config. See <a href=/tmux-config>this page</a> for a deep dive on configuring Tmux.</p><p>Tmux&rsquo;s config file is named <code>tmux.conf</code> and will either be in the user&rsquo;s home directory or <code>~/.config/tmux</code>.</p><h3 id=zsh-config>Zsh config</h3><p>Manjaro ships with an already-customized version of Zsh, and I dislike the prompt and that it uses <a href=https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#arch-linux>a non-supported version of Powerlevel 10k</a>. So for me the second or third thing after a fresh install is dealing with the Zsh setup. It&rsquo;s helpful to know the order in which Zsh loads config files:</p><ol><li><code>.zshenv</code>: should only contain the user&rsquo;s environment variables.</li><li><code>.zprofile</code>: can be used to execute commands after logging in.</li><li><code>.zshrc</code>: use this to configure the shell itself and for running commands.</li><li><code>.zlogin</code>: same purpose as <code>.zprofile</code> except that it is read after <code>.zshrc</code></li><li><code>.zlogout</code>: can be used to execute commands when a shell exits</li></ol><p>These files live in the user&rsquo;s home directory and are created on first use or install. They can be moved to <code>~/.config/zsh</code> and will still be loaded. Not all files must be used. See <a href=/configuring-zsh>this page</a> for the basics on configuring Zsh.</p><p>You might also have some Bash profiles even if you&rsquo;re using Zsh; in Manjaro they&rsquo;re used for terminal colors in X11 applications and situations. You can back them up in the same way as defined for Zsh in the install script - they&rsquo;ll be read from the <code>~/.config/bash</code> directory if you move them.</p><h2 id=install-script>Install script</h2><p>The basic principle behind the install script is that the actual files you wish to version control are saved in the <code>/dotfiles</code> directory and the script creates a symlink between the file in that directory and the default <code>~/.config</code> location. You make changes to the files in <code>/dotfiles</code> and initialize the version control repository in the <code>/dotfiles</code> directory. <a href=https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linking-linux-explained>Here&rsquo;s an explainer</a> on the difference between hard and symlinks and when you should use which. Hard links can only be created for regular files, not directories, and they can only span a single filesystem.</p><p>The structure for a Bash command to create a symbolic link is:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>ln -s &lt;file path to point to&gt; &lt;new file path&gt;
</code></pre><p>Adding the flag <code>-f</code> will <strong>f</strong>orce the creation of the link and remove any existing link or file with the same name before creating the symlink.</p><p>Finally: symlinks can only be created on a new pointer, not an existing file. So the steps the script will take in order are:</p><ol><li>copy the original config file from <code>~/.config</code> to the dotfiles directory</li><li>delete the config file from the <code>~/.config</code> directory</li><li>re-create the application directory within the <code>~/.config</code> directory</li><li>symlink the file from <code>/dotfiles</code> to <code>~/.config</code></li></ol><p>We delete the directory before re-creating it to prevent the system from complaining and failing the script run.</p><p>Each time you add a new entry to the install script, you run it to delete the original configs and create the symlinks. <strong>Don&rsquo;t run the script before copying the configs to the dotfiles directory!</strong> Note also that the script as written here does not include any success statements; it will succeed silently. Run <code>ls -l</code> in the config directory to confirm the symlink was set correctly.</p><h3 id=script-example>Script example</h3><p>An example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>#!/bin/bash
